# ademcan.dev

A **minimal, elegant personal site** that blends my passion for  
**games**, **UI/UX design**, and **writing** into one calm, cohesive space.

More than a portfolio — **a digital journal** where design, code,  
and storytelling meet to capture my journey.

## 📖 Structure

### 🏠 Home  
A simple landing page that introduces who I am and what I care about.  
Features: a reading widget, a highlighted blog post, and a featured project.

### 👤 About  
My personal story and design philosophy — focused on clarity, usability,  
and building meaningful digital experiences.

### 📝 Blog  
A collection of thoughts, ideas, and reflections.  
Short-form notes, longer essays, and personal observations.

### 📂 Projects  
A curated list of my design and development work.  
Interactive case studies showing process, tools, and outcomes.

### 🎮 Playlog  
A personal game diary powered by Backloggd.  
Tracks completed games with dates and short reflections.

### 📚 Reviews  
Structured, in-depth write-ups on games (and sometimes films/books).  
More analytical than Playlog — part review, part reflection.

### 🖼️ Photos  
A hand-picked selection of photography and visual snippets  
that capture my mood and aesthetic.

## ✨ Purpose

This site is my **digital playground** — part journal, part portfolio.  
It exists to **document my growth**, share what I learn, and create a space  
that feels calm, timeless, and uniquely mine.

Minimal design, generous whitespace, and a typography-first approach  
keep the focus on **content, storytelling, and atmosphere**.
