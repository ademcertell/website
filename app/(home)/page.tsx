        <p>As a Junior UI/UX Designer, my focus is on crafting intuitive and visually engaging user experiences. I believe design is more than just aestheticsâ€”it&apos;s a problem-solving process centered around user needs.</p>
        <hr className="border-0 border-b border-zinc-300 opacity-40" />
        <p>By prioritizing usability, I create interfaces that balance functionality and aesthetics, ensuring seamless digital interactions. I am continuously learning, leveraging user feedback to refine processes, and enhancing digital accessibility.</p>
        <p>Beyond design, I develop small-scale frontend projects to make everyday digital experiences more meaningful. I enjoy building practical and minimalist tools that streamline workflows and improve efficiency.</p>
